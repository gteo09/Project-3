# Food Chain

Food Chain is a marketplace created to connect local farms to local businesses to promote the use of locally grown ingredients within communities. 

Using Food Chain on the producer side, users will be able to post what products they have currently available, when they are harvesting future products, and browse purchaser profiles to find other businesses with similar values.

This project is built using the React/JSX framework and features technology such as Passport authentication and the Google Maps API.
