# Food Chain

Food Chain is a marketplace created to connect local farms to local businesses to promote the use of locally grown ingredients within communities. 

With Food Chain users will be able to browse what products local farms currently have, see when those farms are harvesting future products, and browse producer profiles to find other businesses with similar values.

This project is built using the React/JSX framework and features technology such as Passport authentication and the Google Maps API.
